Research and development of a new network tool

Works developed in college

<b><h5> Network Protocol Verification System by Means of Model-Based Testing.</b></h5>
The Name of system developed is MSRP, it was developed by Welliton Fernandes Leal.
Theoretical work, written, is in .PDF format titled as: "Verification of Network Protocol Implementation by means of Model-Based Testing - (Verificação de Implementação de Protocolo de Rede por Meio de Teste Baseado em Modelo - IFPR)"


<h5>HOW TO USE MSRP</h5>

<b>1 - Create the state machine.</b>
You have two options:
 
<b>1.1</b> Model a state machine graphically using the interface buttons:
New state, Delete state and Insert transition.
 
<b>1.2</b> or, Just load an XML state machine through menu FIle > Open XML.

<b>2 - For to check a modeling, compare the model with the trace file:</b>

<b>2.1</b> With the XML file loaded or the graph model of state machine:
You just need to import the trace file and to click on check modeling button.
