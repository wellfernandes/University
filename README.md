Research and development of a new network tool

Works developed in college

<b>Network Protocol Verification System by Means of Model-Based Testing.</b>
The Name of system developed is MSRP, it was developed by Welliton Fernandes Leal.
Theoretical work, written, is in .PDF format titled as: "Verification of Network Protocol Implementation by means of Model-Based Testing - (Verificação de Implementação de Protocolo de Rede por Meio de Teste Baseado em Modelo - IFPR)"


How to use MSRP.

1 - Create the state machine.
You have two options:
 
1.1 Model a state machine graphically using the interface buttons: 
New state, Delete state and Insert transition.
 
1.2 or, Just load an XML state machine through menu FIle > Open XML.

For to check a modeling, compare the model with the trace file:

2 - With the XML file loaded or the graph model of state machine:
You just need to import the trace file and to click on check modeling button.
